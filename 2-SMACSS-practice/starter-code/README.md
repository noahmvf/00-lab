##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I started with the base.css file, and ensured that only the most general elements and styling were added. I then focused on the layout.css file, where I input all styling that solely focused on layout. Even if an element was specified by a class or id, and was more specific than a nav or footer, I included it in the layout if the styling for that particular designation was solely layout focused. Third, I added more specific styling such as coloring, and multiple styles on smaller elements to the modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.
I didn't do any refactoring of the existing CSS because the page I produced after I moved all my CSS styles was the same as the starter-code.
